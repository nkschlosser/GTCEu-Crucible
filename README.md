# GTCEu-Crucible
Repository for development of GTCEu Crucible, a skyblock running on the brand new update to GT lineage GTCEu, as well as Gregicality's additions when available.

## What is it?
A skyblock pack that a variety of assistant content mods to Gregtech, mostly tech focused in nature. GT doesn't require much outside assistance anymore, but mods like AE2 prevent people from wanting to hurl themselves off their skyblock rather than make a factory there. This pack will have reworked recipes to gregify any recipes unfortunate enough to reveal themselves to me, and possibly make certain Gregtech recipes worse. This is a skyblock so resource scarcity isn't a concern. I may not be asking you for Singularities, but some extra processing steps to force new factory designs could definitely be "fun".

Ha.

## Why is it?
There are really only two skyblock offerings currently in development for GTCEu, and while they have some promising points I don't like their overall tone and their approach to the skyblock aspect of the pack causes me pain deep in my soul. I'm also a special sort of masochist and love inflicting pain on myself (by forcing myself to write this) and others (by giving this pack to you <3)

## Where can I find out more?

Nowhere! :)

Jokes aside, the most helpful discord is https://discord.com/invite/bWSWuYvURP - this is where GTCEu and Gregicality are actively developed, and most modpack developers ~~lurk to prey on unsuspecting souls~~ wait to provide assistance to lovely friends and ~~indoctrinate~~ invite them to happy modpacks.
